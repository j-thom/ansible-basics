# The # sign is used to denote comments in YAML files (more on this later)
# The 3 dashes below denote the start of a YAML document 
---

# The basic unit in a YAML document is called a key-value pair or mapping. 
# This uses a basic "key-colon-space-value" syntax. i.e. key: value

firstName: John
lastName: Doe

# The space in that syntax is critical without the space it does not parse correctly
# If you remove the space between key2: and value2 below and have a YAML linter in 
# your editor it should cause a linting error.
key2: value2

# The value of the key can be of many different types, common types are:
# "Quoted String", Unquoted String, Integer, Floating point number and boolean

string1: "This is a quoted string"
string2: This is an unquoted string
int: 42
float: 42.2222
bool: true

# These mappings can also be structured in what is called a hash/dictionary
# In the example below you are also being exposed for the first time to the concept of indentation in YAML. 
# The indentation denotes the relationship between elements of the document. 
# In this case the three elements firstName, lastName and age belong to dict1
# YAML is whitespace delimited, so it's very important that you aren't using Tab characters in your indentation

dict1:
  firstName: John
  lastName: Doe
  age: 42

# The next concept to understand is the YAML array. 
# Each new element in the array, or list item, is prefixed by a dash and a space

list:
  - item1
  - item2
  - item3
