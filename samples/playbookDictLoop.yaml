# In the sample above we can see that, in a use case like this where the parameter to the 
# modules accepts a list as its value, we can still make use of a loop. In this case we
# have multiple supplemental groups that we would like to add to one of the users that we 
# are either creating or insuring the existence of. We are also using a loop over a list
# of dictionaries in this example. This means that each time the loop iterates, we are
# passing two pieces of information the user name and the groups they belong to.
# This is stored in what becomes the item dictionary and we can traverse that information
# using dot notations. I.e. item.name to retrieve the user name and item.groups to retrieve
# the list of groups that the user belongs to.
